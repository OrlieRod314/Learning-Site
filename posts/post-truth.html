			Technology is a means of abstracting human labor for more efficiency. Technology makes life more convenient and generally attempts to improve the human condition. From the printing press to the internet, the most influential technological innovations have been in the area of information dissemination. The internet and social media are the latest evolution of communication technologies, and with it, there have come many challenges.

			Post-truth, according to Laybats and Tredinnick, is the concept that politics is no longer about having a factual debate, and that the strength of emotional appeals instead replaces the degree of truth which would usually validate an argument. Rather than arguing through reasoning, a conclusion is proposed and defended vehemently through emotional arguments. The main implication of this concept is that it becomes the modus operandi of the modern political world. That is, contemporary politics is no longer reliant on objectivity and therefore is no longer trustworthy.

			Social media is meant to provide users with an opportunity to say almost whatever they want to anyone in the word. It is inherently a technology based on the principles of free speech and democracy. However, just as people are free to express their opinions, there is also a lack of accountability that one has for what they say. There is no punishment for willingly spreading fake news, even less so if the poster is anonymous. Kalpolkas, in Conclusion: For Unto Us Post-Truth Is Born, describes post-truth as a co-created fiction, meaning that social media provides an opportunity for a community to collaborate on a shared narrative to which they adhere. The fictional aspect of post-truth is described as escapist in nature. This makes sense because social media allows for people to live inside an echo chamber and escape any form of cognitive dissonance caused by factual debate. This essay examines how exactly technology enables this culture of escapism and echo chambers, how that, in turn, strengthens the post-truth mentality, and possible solutions to post-truth's challenges.

			Feenberg discusses the philosophy of technology, which in summary is the study of the self-awareness of our modern society and the rationality of modernity. He argues that the general population is starting to intervene more in the evolution of technology as it entirely encompasses people's daily lives, and the entire media industry relies on a fixed user base. How social media applications are laid out allows them to interface with people's phones and integrate themselves into every facet of their lives. Need to book an appointment? Google will add it to your calendar. Added a new contact on Facebook? Well you can find them on Snapchat and Instagram now. Because of this, people are essential stakeholders in the social media industry as they've become increasingly dependent on it.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			This dependence on social media is highlighted, especially in Baudrillard's argument. He argues in Simulacra and Simulation that because the media carry both "meaning and counter-meaning" (84), that society is heading towards a "catastrophic" scenario involving communication technology. This conclusion starts out innocently enough: Social media is basically a creative outlet for the average consumer, it gives people the illusion of being content producers through its posting and liking functions. Because people are allowed to say whatever they want on social media, there is no authority to hold them personally responsible for spreading false information. And even if the author of said incorrect information is proven wrong, there's no real incentive to change their opinion on anything. As humans, we hate cognitive dissonance – holding contradictory beliefs – because it jeopardizes our internal epistemic integrity. The possibility of being wrong makes the average consumer construct their narrative of reality. Other functionalities of social media allow people to filter (willingly or through automated algorithms) whatever content they disagree with.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The freedom of selective world-building is what makes social media so dangerous. Allow people to filter out whatever beliefs they want, and they will take advantage of it. Before social media was as important, encountering differing opinions was just a fact of life in a democracy. Diversity of opinion was taken more seriously because of the sanctity of fact-based debate. However, with the emergence of post-truth, there is no longer an incentive to rely on facts – let alone an incentive even to acknowledge the opposition. Instead, political posts on social media are mostly emotional appeals and calls to action directed at causing as much of a disturbance as possible. As more people opt for these technologies, "tribes" of thought can form in which the only cohesive element is an unfounded belief. This unfounded belief is defended solely by the impenetrable barrier of the community. Thus, social media devolves into this positive feedback loop through which fake news can spawn debate riddled with fabricated statistics and logical fallacies, generating even more false information. This cycle leads some – including Baudrillard – to believe that modern society is falling into an ideological death spiral.

			However, I would like to challenge the nihilistic outlook of Baudrillard. As mentioned earlier, Kalpolkas claimed that post-truth is essentially a co-created fiction, a constructed narrative of the world that benefits a group. In his article, he claims that "post-truth is part of the advent of the Experience Age," meaning that people will rely on their own experiences in an age of cognitive overload due to all the information they are receiving. It's only a matter of time before truth inevitably loses due to people's inability to keep up with the constant stream of information. Kalpolkas argues that one of the main attractions of video games is their "real enough" aspect, in which they do not necessarily replace reality, but rather they offer a version of it that feels real enough to exploit the human reward system. Social media is like that in many ways; it takes advantage of the human reward system by introducing "likes" to act as a sort of popularity ranking. People get a dopamine rush from the anticipation of a reward rather than the actual reward itself, and so social media gets people addicted to posting and waiting for likes. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
			That being said, it may be possible to reverse or at least mitigate the effects of post-truth. A possible solution would be to provide social media users with an incentive for being honest and transparent. Since people are emotional shareholders in the social media industry, they should perhaps also be held accountable for their actions. After all, it's not like applications such as Facebook and Instagram cost money to use. This could be done by having people register their identities on social platforms and having more transparency in media algorithms. An issue with this solution, however, is that it would ruin the anonymity of the internet, which is one of its main strengths.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			According to Kalpolkas's reasoning, one of the ways to combat post-truth is perhaps to eliminate the aspect of social media that explicitly takes advantage of the human reward system. Maybe moving away from like/karmic system of online ranking, social media could evolve into more of a forum-like format. A forum is more conductive to free speech than a collection of completely unrelated clickbait posts floating around on an app. The challenge to this idea however would be implementing the changes in such a way that benefits both customers and corporations. And so, there's an apparent conflict of interest here. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Those seem to be the only solutions I can think of that wouldn't outright censor our free speech. Post-truth is just an inherent issue of democracy that's compounded by modern technology. If people are allowed to think what they want, they'll surely take advantage of that and put no effort into evaluating their beliefs.
