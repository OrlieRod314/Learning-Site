            This is probably one of my better projects that I’ve made in a while. So, I’ve previously had numerous blogs that ended for various reasons. I used WordPress to make one and it was alright, the formatting was decent, I guess. But the themes were too limited and couldn’t accommodate what I was looking for. Although, I would have kept going if it weren’t for one fatal flaw: I didn’t like the idea of having to pay to remove the WordPress logo from the site. The posts I made there were pretty cool though. Nice introduction to blogging.

            My second attempt was creating an Instagram account to show to people, but that was pretty bad because of the addictive nature of social media. The app became more of a distraction than a venue to get my stuff out.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then my third attempt was to get a domain from Google, which ended up being <a href="https://www.orlier.com/index.html">www.orlier.com</a> (this site). But they had some weird Blogger site editor that made it look weird, and that wasn’t really customizable. It worked well though because I would just give people the address and they could get to it immediately. And it was also pretty efficient in that it was laid out and just required me to write and then post. However, I didn’t like the idea of having to conform to the UI’s limitations.
          </p>

            Then I knew that I would only be happy if I built my site from the ground up. So, I took an online Harvard web design course (the CS50 series), and I learned some more HTML, CSS, and version control with Git. After I completed it, I decided to work on my own site and then publish it.
          </p>
          <p>
            My final and hardest attempt was to delete the synthetic record in my DNS settings so that the domain would no longer connect to the Blogger Site, and then I used Netlify to forward to my GitHub pages. This way, I could have my own domain AND have complete creative freedom with my content. It took forever to figure out how to do it, mostly because I forgot to switch my name servers from Google’s to Netlify’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, I’m pretty happy with the final attempt because I did this all in a span of about 24 hours, from the time I got the idea to the time the DNS settings were configured. I’m not really counting the time it took for the servers to handle it because that’s outside of my control, I timed it so I could sleep while they finished configuring.

            I just realized I did all this to get rid of a WordPress logo…

        <p>Seriously, if you want to make your own site it's super easy. Just learn some web design and make sure you're using the right services. </p>
        <p>Also, I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with using a site generator or services like WordPress. They are very successful because of the simple fact that most people don't have the time to learn how to make a site. And I think it's an excellent service for people like that. So feel free to make a site however you want. As long as it serves its purpose, it's all good.</p>
