          Hey there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a freshman at the University of Arizona, class of 2023. This blog is an effort to share my projects, ideas, and interests with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I daydream a lot, and a sure way to embarrass me is to walk in when I’m talking to myself about an idea of some sort. As you can probably tell, I really enjoy documenting things and engaging in my own creative endeavors. In fact, sometimes my projects distract me from more urgent matters like homework (for example, the entire afternoon I spent making this site). But it doesn’t matter, I’ve gotten better at managing my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a little bit about me I guess:
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in Arizona in 2000. My childhood and schooling were anything but ordinary. I was always a very obsessive kid, I could focus on one thing for literal hours, while the rest of my classmates would get yelled at to sit down. My parents thought it would be a good idea to sit me in front of a computer and teach me how to use Microsoft Office, you know, to teach me something useful. Because of my unrestricted access to the internet, I discovered YouTube, and I would spend all day watching videos when the site was in its infancy. At the same time, my family tried to get me into sports, which was an ultimate failure (way more on that later though).
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my deepest interests is programming, which I’ve technically been doing since middle school. My programming journey has two beginnings, really. It first started when I got an XBOX 360 in Kindergarten. My favorite pastime became playing Call of Duty -a game I really shouldn’t have played at 6 years old- which got me interested in history and military technology. Years later in middle school, I had already been well-versed in video games, and thought it would be cool to make my own. I designed a game using a pirated copy of RPG Maker 2003 (which I later found out was free anyways). Obviously, being 12 years old at the time, my game was absolutely horrible and didn’t work at all, mostly because I was just clicking on the design interface until something worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second beginning of my programming journey was when I discovered over time that I could actually make sites, applications, and video games from my computer. For some reason, that was inexplicably empowering for me, knowing that I could MAKE things, and SHARE them with people. I had spent my entire life before that just consuming content. I knew that I could teach myself what I needed to create good-looking sites and engaging programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering high school, I had amassed some good starter knowledge of programming. Alongside some friends, I founded the University High School programming club, where we taught each other how to code in HTML, CSS, JS, and Java. However, the bureaucracy of the club – and members who thought of it as just a social hour- inhibited the learning process. So, I decided to broaden my horizons and look for another endeavor. I got into robotics and joined the local independent FRC league team, The Bitbuckets 4183.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time I spent on that team was quite arguably the most formative time of my life. I learned a lot about what it means to devote yourself to a group of people. It was the first team that I ever liked being in, as beforehand, the only collaborative work I had done was group work in school, and we all know how that usually goes. On the team, I got to know a ton of like-minded individuals, each with their own specializations and creative themes. I got to travel and compete with them in other states, and along the way I learned so much more about robotics and design than I would have in school. At the end of my junior year, all the experienced seniors were graduating and we were going to be left with no real authority. I saw this issue and reformed the team myself by creating a handbook and restructuring the administration when no one else would. It was real passion. I quickly worked my way up the ranks and became the administrative lead for the team (after all, I did make the position).
        </p>
        <p>
          My senior year was absolutely amazing, I got to experience more freedom at home, and I felt like a valued member of my team. I also got to spend one last year with all my childhood friends who had been at my side through it all. Although we mostly went to the same college, the sense of finality and closure was there anyways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then college started…
        </p>
        <p>
          And my life got even better. I joined the fencing team, which was important to me because it was the first sport I ever joined willingly AND kept doing. I am very devoted to fencing (I do Epee), and I compete in other states with the whole team representing the University of Arizona.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined CyberCats, a competitive cybersecurity club, and then I joined a professor’s research team specializing in Graphical Neural Networks and symmetry detection in graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess the moral of my story is that if you have an interest, you should follow it. You never know how far you’ll go. And at the same time, it’s never too late to branch out and start something new.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, I gotta go help around the house and then study all afternoon lol. See ya.
