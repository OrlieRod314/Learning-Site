		Well the school year is essentially over for me. It’s been a fun year I’d have to say. The whole coronavirus situation ruined my plans and I might have to spend the rest of Spring indoors. My classes got kind of hard when we moved online. My school allowed us to pass/fail our courses, so I took advantage of that to boost my GPA if I got anything lower than an A in a course. 
        </p>

		My only worry for now is to get my stuff out of the dorm before everyone starts scrambling in on the 15th. It’s a pretty unfortunate situation. On one hand, I want to have all my stuff back and I’ll get charged if I leave anything in my room. On the other hand, I really don’t want to risk getting sick. I guess I’ll have to put on a mask and gloves to enter the dorm.
        </p>

		Anyways, I just want to get that over with so I can rest easy for the next few months. I have plenty of things planned for the summer, most of which are learning and creative projects:
