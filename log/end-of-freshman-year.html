		Well the school year is essentially over for me. It’s been a fun year I’d have to say. The whole coronavirus situation ruined my plans and I might have to spend the rest of Spring indoors. My classes got kind of hard when we moved online. My school allowed us to pass/fail our courses, so I took advantage of that to boost my GPA if I got anything lower than an A in a course. 
        </p>
		<p>
		My only worry for now is to get my stuff out of the dorm before everyone starts scrambling in on the 15th. It’s a pretty unfortunate situation. On one hand, I want to have all my stuff back and I’ll get charged if I leave anything in my room. On the other hand, I really don’t want to risk getting sick. I guess I’ll have to put on a mask and gloves to enter the dorm.
        </p>
		<p>
		Anyways, I just want to get that over with so I can rest easy for the next few months. I have plenty of things planned for the summer, most of which are learning and creative projects:
        </p>
		<p>Software Projects:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Machine learning research at U of A</li>
		  <li>Personal machine learning project</li>
		  <li>Working on this website</li>
		  <li>Personal Assistant Application</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Learning:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Teach myself CS 245 material</li>
		  <li>Teach myself Java and do projects to prepare for CS 210</li>
		  <li>Learn Russian</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Personal Pursuits:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Work out more/get fit/decrease body fat percentage</li>
		  <li>Read GEB</li>
		  <li>Memory Training</li>
		  <li>Dopamine Fast</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		I really want to get better at programming because I have a ton of ideas for projects that I want to work on. I think that I should take advantage of this quarantine to improve myself. The way I view it:  If I needed a sign to improve on certain aspects of my life, this is definitely it. This is the closest I’ll probably ever get to a sign telling me to fix things. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I really want to study ahead for computer science because I really want to get straight A’s starting next semester. I didn’t really work hard enough in the fall and then the Coronavirus situation happened and I couldn’t really do well in some classes. Honestly, I really want to figure things out this summer. I think that I should take advantage of having nothing to do. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In other news, I got elected as secretary of the fencing team at my school. I’m pretty happy because I can have an opportunity to contribute to the team. There’s a lot of nasty bureaucratic processes I have to go through as secretary, such as submitting forms and negotiating with the people at the recreational center.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Well, I’m in for a tough summer in terms of work to put in. I’ll keep this updated.
