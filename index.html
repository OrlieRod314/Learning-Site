         Our Mission
    </h2>
    <div id="container">
      <p>
          We want Chernyy Table (working title) to be the engine of a smarter humanity.

      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
          We do this in two ways:
      </p>
      <p>Making more people really effective</p>
      <p>Helping existing smart people get resources</p>

      <p>
          That’s literally it. These have guided us through our history, from our earliest days in 2020, as a humble collection of links and study tips, to the people-connecting juggernaut of 2040.
      </p>
      <p>
          We knew traditional schools were trying to do (1), and plenty of smart people in Silicon Valley were (and still are) focusing on (2). And these solutions actually worked surprisingly well… if you were already really smart.
      </p>
      <p>
          For “the rest of us”, smart-ish people, the mediocre programmers and engineers and artists and designers and scientists of the world…. how could we be like them? The cognitive elite, the prodigies, the super-smart. What were they doing that we weren’t?
      </p>
      <p>
          This simple question, radical in its implications, led us to another: What if we could create prodigies? Give people the best resources on how to git good (and keep them updated), use those resources ourselves to demonstrate their power, build a network of fellow ambitious people, find niches where they would do well, and empower them to do more. We realized we could intensify people’s knowledge (and accomplishments) if we helped them both specialize (to take advantage of their skills), and broaden (to reach out to others in the network for help).
      </p>
      <p>
          Hence, today’s Chernyy Table (working title) is more than one thing. It’s kinda like a resource directory, online community, job placement agency, detective agency, and scientific society all in one. We’re still not sure what it really is, but at heart Chernyy Table (working title) is a group of ambitious people trying to be the best at what they do. In the words of one of our co-founders, Orlando Rodriguez-Kuznetsov: “It’s like having a giant super-person that’s good at everything.” To which I’d have to add: “Not yet.”
