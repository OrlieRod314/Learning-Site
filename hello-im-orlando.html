          It's nice to meet you.
        </p>

          I'm a freshman at the University of Arizona, class of 2023, majoring in Computer Science and possibly Data Science or Mathematics. This blog is an effort to to share the journey with you as I work on exciting projects and experience new things. I'm from Tucson, and I've lived here pretty much my entire life. I have many interests such as programming, web design, fencing (with swords, not building fences), and exploring... oh, and being a student, I guess. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of going to university and learning about what I like to do, but I also like to do things outside of studying (maybe a little bit too much).
        </p>
        <p>
          As I go forward with this blog, I will be posting two main types of updates. The first type is personal/discussion updates, where I just talk about things that interest me and what's going on in my life. My other category of posts will be software/project updates. I will mostly be talking about my own creations and what they're for. I will also detail my thought process here.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, I know that some people will come to this site either to learn more about me, learn more about my projects, or just see what I have to say about certain topics. This is why I'm going to mark posts with either a discussion, personal, or project label.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, with all of those statements taken care of, I think it's about time I get back to studying for a while. Then the fun begins! See ya.
